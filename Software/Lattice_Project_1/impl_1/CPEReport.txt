create_clock -name {clk_i} -period 20 [get_ports clk_i] originating in instance I2C_DPHY_1_inst was removed because it is defined at a clock input pin of the IP. User constraints should ensure the corresponding top-level port is correctly constrained at the top-level. If kept it may cause incorrect slack calculation.
